# 🩺 Pneumonia Detection using MobileNetV2



## 📌 Overview
This project aims to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a lightweight and efficient deep learning model, **MobileNetV2**. The model achieves an accuracy of **84%** and is deployed through a simple and interactive **Streamlit** web application.

---

## 🧠 Features
- Predicts whether a chest X-ray image indicates **Pneumonia** or **Normal**.
- Built with **MobileNetV2**, optimized for performance and size.
- User-friendly **Streamlit** interface to upload and analyze images.
- Real-time prediction and display of classification results.

## 🧪 Dataset

We used the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle, which includes:

* **Normal** images
* **Pneumonia**-infected images (bacterial and viral)

> Make sure to download and place the dataset correctly for training if you retrain the model.
